{"name":"D&D Generator","tagline":"Random Character Generator for D&D","body":"This is a D&D Random Character Generator.  Given some set constants (or none at\r\nall) it will go ahead and generate the rest of a player character for you.  The\r\noriginal goal in conceiving this software was to put together a generator that\r\nwould help a rushed DM create fleshed out high level NPCs for player characters\r\nto encounter.\r\n\r\nThe generator though is equally useful for those that need to quickly roll up a\r\ncharacter in order to join a game, or for those that do not care about some or\r\nall of the details of their character.  The generator is designed so that you\r\ncan fill in the details that you care about and let it fill in the rest.\r\n\r\nBrowser Support\r\n====================\r\nThis application does NOT support older versions of Internet Explorer, namely\r\nIE6, IE7, and IE8.  If you are using an older browser, you will have to upgrade\r\nto make use of this software.  I encourage you to check out Mozilla Firefox,\r\nwhich is a great modern alternative to older versions of Internet Explorer (and\r\nfor that matter Internet Explorer in general).  You can find Mozilla Firefox at\r\nthe following URL:\r\n  http://www.getfirefox.com/\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Data Packages\r\n====================\r\nDue to the constraints of the Open Game License there is a lot of content that\r\nI would like to support in this application that can not be directly distributed\r\nwith the application.  These include things such as the gods from the Player's\r\nHandbook or the backstory generation from the Hero Builder's guide.\r\n\r\nThe data folder contains [frictionless data packages][2] that contain all of the\r\ndata that is used by the application.  See the packages README in the data\r\ndirectory for more information on making and distributing data packages for this\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThis software comes with the following data packages:\r\n* Standard Packaged Data for D&D Generator\r\n    This package includes all data required for the D&D Character Sheet\r\n    Generator that doesn't fit well into another package, but is still required\r\n    to run the generator. _Created by Derric Atzrott and Vin.
