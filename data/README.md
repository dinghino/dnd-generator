Understanding Data Packages
====================
Due to the constraints of the Open Game License there is a lot of content that
I would like to support in this application that can not be directly distributed
with the application.  These include things such as the gods from the Player's
Handbook or the back-story generation from the Hero Builder's guide.

The data folder contains [frictionless data packages][1] that contain all of the
data that is used by the application.  See the packages README in the data
directory for more information on making and distributing data packages for this
application.

This software comes with the following data packages:
* Standard Packaged Data for D&D Generator
    This package includes all data required for the D&D Character Sheet
    Generator that doesn't fit well into another package, but is still required
    to run the generator. _Created by Derric Atzrott and Vin. Released under the
    CC-0 license._
* D&D 3.5 Players Handbook Data
    This package contains a machine readable copy of the OGL Licensed data from
    the Players Handbook. _Open Game License v 1.0 Copyright 2000, Wizards of
    the Coast, Inc. Released under the Open Game License v 1.0._
* Deities of The Faithful Package
    This package contains the deities list from Sean Reynolds "Deities of
    The Faithful". _Skreyn's Register: The Bonds of Magic and "Deities of The
    Faithful" Copyright 2002 Sean K Reynolds. All rights reserved. Released
    under the Open Game License v 1.0._
