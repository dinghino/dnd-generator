          <p>This is a D&amp;D Random Character Generator.  Given some set constants (or none at
all) it will go ahead and generate the rest of a player character for you.  The
original goal in conceiving this software was to put together a generator that
would help a rushed DM create fleshed out high level NPCs for player characters
to encounter.</p>

<p>The generator though is equally useful for those that need to quickly roll up a
character in order to join a game, or for those that do not care about some or
all of the details of their character.  The generator is designed so that you
can fill in the details that you care about and let it fill in the rest.</p>

<p>This application does NOT support older versions of Internet Explorer, namely
IE6, IE7, and IE8.  If you are using an older browser, you will have to upgrade
to make use of this software.  I encourage you to check out Mozilla Firefox,
which is a great modern alternative to older versions of Internet Explorer (and
for that matter Internet Explorer in general).  You can find Mozilla Firefox at

<p>Due to the constraints of the Open Game License there is a lot of content that
I would like to support in this application that can not be directly distributed
with the application.  These include things such as the gods from the Player's
Handbook or the backstory generation from the Hero Builder's guide.</p>

<p>The data folder contains <a href="http://dataprotocols.org/data-packages/" title="Frictionless Data Package">frictionless data packages</a> that contain all of the
data that is used by the application.  See the packages README in the data
directory for more information on making and distributing data packages for this
application.</p>

<p>This software comes with the following data packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard Packaged Data for D&amp;D Generator

Generator that doesn't fit well into another package, but is still required
